# ZashaGermanVocabular
For my personal German practice.

source deutsch-woerter.sh : process the Word doc and update the list of words and the HTML for the web site (after 'git push'). After doing this, you must import deutsch-woerter.tsv to AnkiWeb
see comments at the beginning of ProcessDeutschWoerter.py for instructions on how to import AnkiWeb.

source test-deutsch-woerter.sh : test processing the Word doc, but don't update any official files.
